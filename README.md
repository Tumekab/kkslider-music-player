# K.K.Slider Music Player
This web application is for all Animal Crossing fans to enjoy the much beloved musician K.K.Slider's music online. Listen whilst you study, work or playing Animal Crossing for some cozy vibes. 
This project was completely inspired by my own love for Animal Crossing and the awesome community that has been built around it. 
I wanted this to be made for the rest of the Animal Crossing community and keep it open source for the ability to have other's contribute.

<br>The first iteration (MVP) of this is made by me and maintained by me. I welcome any feedback and improvements!
