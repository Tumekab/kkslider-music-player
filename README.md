# K.K.Slider Music Player ðŸŽµ
This web application is for all Animal Crossing fans to enjoy the much beloved musician K.K.Slider's music online. Listen whilst you study, work or playing Animal Crossing for some cozy vibes. 
This project was completely inspired by my own love for Animal Crossing and the awesome community that has been built around it. 
I wanted this to be made for the rest of the Animal Crossing community and keep it open source for the ability to have other's contribute.

<br>The first iteration (MVP) of this is made by me and maintained by me. 
<br>ðŸŒŸ I welcome any feedback and improvements! ðŸŒŸ

# MVP
The inital idea and concept of this application is to be able to view all of K.K Slider's songs and once a user clicks on their chosen song, the song will start playing. I really wanted to make good use of the artwork for each song as they are truly loved by players of the game.
### MVP Feature
- A user will be able to pause/play.
- Have the ability to skip forward and skip backwards.
- Shuffle through the whole library of songs.
- Be able to repeat a song.

# Design
Here is a mock up of the design that was created using Figma;

I wanted to keep it simple for the MVP so that I had a good base to improve upon.
